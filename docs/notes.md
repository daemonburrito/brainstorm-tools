# Storm

* [ ] Arbitrary taxonomies selected via select dialog
* [ ] "Lighttable"-like functionality
* [ ] GFM at a minimum, plus Latex and escaped Latex->UTF-8 (âˆ€, e.g.)
* [ ] IDE server compatibility
* [ ] ALL platforms, even if we break license. Electron for desktop, web app, Android, anything that can run JS and talk HTTP.
* [ ] Git-like crypto secure. Every entity has a cryptographic signature. Blockchain a possibility, but also GPG capable.
* [ ] Arbitrary types of entities.
* [ ] Each entity has a history, as does each taxonomy. Missing entities handled gracefully.
* [ ] Intra-entity links possible (hypertext).
* [ ] Blessed taxonomies exportable (e.g., a book)
* [ ] Danger: avoid reimplement the web. However,  code including HTML is exportable with exporters that can be created.
* [ ] In addition to the whole map of "yarn" having its own crypto identity and history, each "piece" of yarn has the same metadata.
* [ ] "Missing" entities can be replaced (loaded from the filesystem) or recreated from scratch.
