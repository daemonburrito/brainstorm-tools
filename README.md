# Brainstorming Tools

## Differences between "MindMaps" and other similar conceptual models
* This software allows any connections between entities, in any direction, which some software allows but mind maps do not.
* This software has an emphasis on a customizable, pluggable set of tools to enable the user to have the appropriate tools at hand.
  * For example, specific plotting tools may be needed for a specific node or entity. The user should have the freedom to assemble the palette based on the subject of the idea.
* Unlike "table"-like journals, where each cell is potentially running code or simulation, connections between "cells" can take many forms. Speed takes precendence, organization is assisted later.
* All linked tools will be FLOSS or at least FOSS. Proprietary license agreements will never be entered into for third-party tooling.
